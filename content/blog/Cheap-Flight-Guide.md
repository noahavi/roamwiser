*Flying smart means flying cheap.*

## ✈️ Be Flexible With Dates and Destinations

Airfare varies significantly depending on the day of the week, season, and even time of day. Flying mid-week or during off-peak times often results in cheaper fares. Use tools like **Google Flights**, **Skyscanner**, or **Hopper** to explore the cheapest days to fly across a month.

Equally important is flexibility in your destination. If you're dreaming of Europe, don’t lock yourself into Paris or Rome—consider flying into **Madrid**, **Brussels**, or **Oslo** if flights are significantly cheaper.

## 🔀 Use Disconnected Legs and Budget Carriers

One of the best ways to save big is by **building your own route**:

- Fly a **low-cost transatlantic carrier** like *Norse Atlantic Airways* to London.
- From there, book a **separate leg** on *Ryanair*, *easyJet*, or *Wizz Air* to your final European destination.

*Self-transfer between budget airlines can cut costs, but plan buffer time!*

> ⚠️ **Warning:** These airlines will **not help** if you miss a connection—give yourself plenty of time between flights (minimum 4–6 hours) and consider spending a night in your layover city.

## 🌍 Check Nearby Airports

Flying into or out of **alternative airports** can result in major savings. For example:

- Try **Newark** or **Philadelphia** instead of JFK.
- Use **Milan-Bergamo** or **Brussels-Charleroi** instead of main city airports.

Skyscanner’s “Search nearby airports” feature can uncover hidden deals.

## 🧳 Plan Disconnected Stopovers

Rather than booking straight from City A to City C, consider breaking up the trip:

1. **New York → Reykjavik**  
2. Spend 2 days exploring Iceland  
3. **Reykjavik → Paris**

This trick not only saves money, but gives you an **extra mini-trip**!

## ⚠️ Use Skiplagging Cautiously

Skiplagging—buying a multi-leg ticket and skipping the final leg—can save money. But be aware:

- Your **frequent flyer account** can be suspended  
- The **airline may cancel** your return ticket  
- You **can’t check bags**, as they’ll go to the final destination

Use this trick sparingly and only when you understand the consequences.

---

## 🎒 Travel Light

Low-cost carriers charge for almost everything—especially baggage. Keep costs down by:

- Packing a **personal item** or **carry-on only**
- Using **packing cubes** to compress clothes  
- Wearing bulky items (like jackets) on the plane
